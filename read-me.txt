** HOW TO **

You've unpacked the zip-file, great job! Now do the following:

1. Rename the folder to what you want - IMPORTANT! Only small letters and hyphen between words.

2. Open "style.css"

3. Change information in stylesheet according to your specific use
	a) Theme name --> What your want to call your child theme
	b) Template --> The parent template you have chosen.
	c) Version --> Usually your start at 1.0.0 when released (major version change, read more on https://semver.org/) but change to your liking. 
	d) Description --> Short description. Usually for the product or costumer to whom the child template is created for. 
	e) Author --> You, who are making the child theme.

4. Place folder with the two files on your server in the folder ".../wp-content/theme/".

5. Style on your CSS to see the magic.
